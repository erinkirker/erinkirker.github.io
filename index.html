		  				<p>I was born in 2015 in the lovely suburb of Wantirna, Victoria to Ralph and Vanilla. I am one of six, though I am adamant that I am the favourite child. At the tender age of eight weeks, I was scooped up in the arms of Erin and jetted off to my new life in the suburbs.</p>
		  				<p>I like causing trouble; always have ever since I arrived. Within my first few days I had already destroyed the toys I'd been given, bitten everyone's feet repeatedly and cried until I got my way. Not to mention the peeing.</p>
		  				<p>Eventually I was introduced to <i>Sam,</i>, the current boss dog. He was definitely miffed at my arrival but a bat of my long eyelashes soon fixed that. Who could resist such a pretty face?</p>
		  				<p>Nowadays you'll find me nestled in Erin's bed or ripped up any combination of plants, furniture or toys. I love to play and sleep in strange positions. I'm a dog of the world, and nobdody can stop me.</p>
		  				<p>Unless I'm on a leash, I guess.</p>
